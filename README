SYNOPSIS

    my $object = Device::Davis::Strmon->new();

DESCRIPTION

    This module is the protocol parser for the output of the Davis ISS data
    received after sending 'STRMON' to the console. I'm using this in
    combination with the ISS packet receiver written by Dekay to fetch data
    from my weather station and to feed it into my home automation system.

METHODS

 new(%parameters)

    This constructor returns a new Device::Davis::Strmon object. Supported
    parameters are listed below

    verbose

      Allows to set the verbosity level of the module.

 decode($input)

    Takes a raw string as received over the serial port and returns the
    information in the packet as a hash. The actual contents of the return
    values of course depend on the packet that was received.

    Note: output from the device after sending STRMON looks like:

    0 = 50

    1 = 0

    2 = B4

    3 = FF

    4 = 73

    5 = C

    6 = 18

    7 = 51

    8 = FF

    9 = FF

    Every line is separated with a 0x0A 0x0D. The string is terminaled with
    two consecutive 0x0A 0x0D sequences. This is validated in the module.

 BUILD

    Helper function to run custome code after the object has been created
    by Moose.

 CREDITS

    Major thanks to Dekay and Darios who did all of the reverse engineering
    of the packets. References:
